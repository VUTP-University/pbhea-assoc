            The "Positioning Bulgarian Higher Education Abroad" Association (PBHEA) was established with the mission to promote and enhance the prestige and quality of Bulgarian higher education on the international stage.
            <br /><br />
            We unite the efforts of leading Bulgarian higher education institutions and their partners to:
            <br />â€¢ Build a positive and recognizable image of Bulgaria as an educational destination;
            <br />â€¢ Support the export of Bulgarian higher education through international programs and initiatives;
            <br />â€¢ Facilitate the attraction of international students and the creation of academic partnerships;
            <br />â€¢ Actively participate in national and European policies in the field of education and science.
            <br /><br />
            The association is an independent and expert platform serving as a bridge between higher education, government institutions, business, and international partners.
            Our vision is for Bulgaria to become a global leader in accessible, high-quality, and innovative higher education.
